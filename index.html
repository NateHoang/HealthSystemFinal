    <h3>
      Q1: According to the presentation on the Vision for Oral Health Systems:
    </h3>
    <ul data-correct="4">
      <li>
        We currently lack the systems and information needed for dental care to
        effectively improve the health of entire communities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dental practices are limited to improving the health of individual
        patients who seek care in offices or clinics.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dental payment systems primarily support improving community health
        rather than focusing on individual patient care.
      </li>
      <li>
        We already have the necessary understanding and systems in place for
        dental care to improve the health of communities.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Q2:A ____________________can be characterized as a full-service
      community-based system
    </h3>
    <ul data-correct="2">
      <li>PPO</li>
      <li>Virtual Dental Home</li>
      <li>HMO</li>
      <li>Consolidated Practice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>

      with are:
    </h3>
    <ul data-correct="2">
      <li>
        Acute disease conditions that can be treated with acute-care surgical
        interventions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chronic diseases that are best managed with ‘chronic disease management’
        techniques.
      </li>
      <li>Chronic diseases that can be cured by dental treatment.</li>
      <li>Acute disease conditions that can be cured by medications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Q4: Which of the following is a principle of behavior change that supports
      the adoption of “Mouth Health Habits”?
    </h3>
    <ul data-correct="2">
      <li>
        Encouraging large and dramatic behavior changes to accelerate results.
      </li>
      <li>
        Messages delivered through trusted, culturally congruent community
        members.
      </li>
      <li>Limiting reinforcement so individuals remain self-motivated.</li>
      <li>
        Relying only on dental professionals to provide the health message.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Q5: Which telehealth modality best describes systems that allow providers
      to review patient records at a later time rather than during a live
      interaction?
    </h3>
    <ul data-correct="3">
      <li>Live Video (synchronous)</li>
      <li>Remote Patient Monitoring</li>
      <li>Store-and-Forward (asynchronous)</li>
      <li>Mobile Health (mHealth)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="week-8">Week 8 - Out of class</h2>

    <h3>Question 1</h3>
    <p>
      What statement best describes the impact of Dental Service Organizations
      (DSOs) on the oral health industry?
    </p>
    <ul data-correct="3">
      <li>
        Although there has been a decrease in the number of dentists in solo
        private practice, the percent of dentists in a solo private practice has
        been slowly increasing in the last few years.
      </li>
      <li>
        The fastest growing segment of the dental industry is DSOs with 10-20
        employees.
      </li>
      <li>
        The number of dentists working for or with dental service organizations
        has been increasing with over 10% of dentists working for or with a DSO
        in 2022.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 2022, for the first time, the percent of dentists working with or for
        a DSO was over 50%
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 2</h3>
    <p>
      The “Vision for Oral Health Systems” described in the presentation focused
      on:
    </p>
    <ul data-correct="4">
      <li>
        The “Quadruple Aim” which added the experiences of providers to the
        Triple Aim.
      </li>
      <li>
        The “Iron Triangle” which linked improving experiences of care for
        patients with improving the health of population and decreasing the
        per-capita cos of care.
      </li>
      <li>
        The “Triple Aim” including improving experiences of care for patients,
        improving the health of populations, and decreasing the per-capita cos
        of care.
      </li>
      <li>
        The “Golden Rings” including measurement and payment systems, prevention
        and behavior science, and delivery systems.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 3</h3>
    <p>According to the presentation on the Vision for Oral Health Systems:</p>
    <ul data-correct="4">
      <li>
        We do not yet have the systems or information we need to have dental
        care systems able to improve the health of communities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dental payment systems mostly pay for improving community health as
        opposed to health of induvial patients.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dental practices can only focus on improving the health of patients who
        come to the dental office or clinic.
      </li>
      <li>
        We have the understanding we need to have dental care systems able to
        improve the health of communities.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 4</h3>
    <p>
      The primary oral diseases that oral health professionals need to deal with
      are:
    </p>
    <ul data-correct="1">
      <li>
        Chronic diseases that are best managed with ‘chronic disease management’
        techniques.
      </li>
      <li>Chronic diseases that can be cured by dental treatment.</li>
      <li>Acute disease conditions that can be cured by medications.</li>
      <li>
        Acute disease conditions that can be treated with acute-care surgical
        interventions.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 5</h3>
    <p>
      The most effective way for oral health professionals to support people
      with a lot of dental disease in adopting “mouth healthy habits” is to:
    </p>
    <ul data-correct="4">
      <li>
        Give people information at every dental visit about plaque removal and
        reducing sugar intake.
      </li>
      <li>
        Talk to people who don’t get regular dental care at health fairs in the
        community about plaque removal and reducing sugar intake.
      </li>
      <li>
        Focus information given at dental visits just on toothbrushing in order
        not to overwhelm people with too much information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Partner with community organizations or personnel who can be in touch
        with people on a regular basic and train and help them in supporting the
        adoption of mouth-healthy habits”.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 6</h3>
    <p>The Virtual Dental Home system can best be characterized as:</p>
    <ul data-correct="3">
      <li>A call-center system</li>
      <li>A limited-service community-based system</li>
      <li>A full-service community-based system</li>
      <li>An advice and referral system</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="week-9">Week 9 - In Class</h2>
    <h3>Q1: The primary goal of a Community-Engaged Oral Health System is:</h3>
    <ul data-correct="3">
      <li>
        Engaging people in community settings for education and screening and
        then referring them to a dental office for a full examination and other
        treatment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Getting people like teachers in schools or nurses in nursing homes to
        supervise tooth brushing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reaching people in community sites and using multiple tools and
        techniques to keep as many people healthy in the community site as
        possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Primarily providing education sessions so people will know what to do to
        maintain oral health.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Q2: The example in the presentation that referred to a rural dental
      practice was based on the idea that:
    </h3>
    <ul data-correct="4">
      <li>
        If a dentist locates their dental practice in a rural area, people are
        generally willing to drive long distances, making it possible to have a
        viable dental practice in a rural area.
      </li>
      <li>
        A dentist with an office in a rural area can serve more patients if the
        dentist establishes satellite offices in neighboring communities and the
        dentist travels to different offices on different days.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is not viable for a dentist to open a dental office in a rural
        community even if the dentist uses teledentistry, because there still
        will not be enough patients.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a dentist opens an office in a rural area and also has a hygienist
        who can travel to neighboring communities and they are connected in a
        Virtual Dental Home system, the dentist can have a viable rural
        practice.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Q3: The “Concentric Circles of Care in Community Engaged Oral Health
      Systems” concept is based on the idea that:
    </h3>
    <ul data-correct="4">
      <li>
        Community screening and prevention sessions can help get people into
        dental offices and clinics.
      </li>
      <li>Most people don’t need much dental care.</li>
      <li>
        Dental hygienists can take care of the same problems that dentists can,
        but at lower cost.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most people in the United States do not get dental care, or at least not
        regular care, in dental offices and clinics and engaging other people
        and organizations is essential to provide oral health services for the
        majority of the population.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Q4: In the Concentric Circles of Care model of community-engaged oral
      health systems, the first 2 levels of care represent oral health
      professionals who deliver the care or services. The 3rd level represents:
    </h3>
    <ul data-correct="4">
      <li>home education using videos.</li>
      <li>referring patients for specialized care.</li>
      <li>public health professionals providing screening.</li>
      <li>non-health professionals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Q5: Non-health professionals can play an important role in improving oral
      health outcomes in the community. Which demonstration example in the
      presentation used school staff to gather oral health information and take
      photographs of the child's mouth that was analyzed by an AI system and
      used for a remote oral health professional? Group of answer choices
    </h3>
    <ul data-correct="4">
      <li>Ravenswood Family Health</li>
      <li>Center Shorten the Line</li>
      <li>Home Visitors in Riverside County</li>
      <li>Kindergarten Oral Health Assessment (KOHA)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="week-9">Week 9 - Out of Class</h2>

    <h3>Question 1</h3>
    <p>
      The example in the presentation that referred to a rural dental practice
      was based on the idea that:
    </p>
    <ul data-correct="4">
      <li>
        A dentist with an office in a rural area can serve more patients if the
        dentist establishes satellite offices in neighboring communities and the
        dentist travels to different offices on different days.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a dentist locates their dental practice in a rural area, people are
        generally willing to drive long distances, making it possible to have a
        viable dental practice in a rural area.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is not viable for a dentist to open a dental office in a rural
        community even if the dentist uses teledentistry, because there still
        will not be enough patients.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a dentist opens an office in a rural area and also has a hygienist
        who can travel to neighboring communities and they are connected in a
        Virtual Dental Home system, the dentist can have a viable rural
        practice.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 2</h3>
    <p>
      The example in the presentation that referred to urban school-based health
      centers was based on the fact that:
    </p>
    <ul data-correct="4">
      <li>
        School-based health centers tend to have good internet connections and
        therefore are good place to locate Virtual Dental Home systems
      </li>
      <li>
        Many school-based health centers are served by partnerships with health
        centers and health centers have limited capacity compared to the need
        for their services.
      </li>
      <li>
        If there is a school-based health center in a particular community, then
        there will be very few dental offices in that community.
      </li>
      <li>
        School-based health centers tend to have only one or just a few dental
        chairs and try to serve many more children than can be seen in those
        chairs.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 3</h3>
    <p>
      The part of the presentation about the Virtual Dental Home system at the
      Ravenswood Heath Center illustrated that:
    </p>
    <ul data-correct="1">
      <li>
        Once a dental care provider learns how to efficiently operate a Virtual
        Dental Home system, it is possible to expand their services to many
        locations in their geographic area.
      </li>
      <li>
        The best way for a dentist to review telehealth records is to do so in
        real time as the record are collected so they can ask the dental
        hygienist about anything they see that they have questions about.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a distinct limit to the number of sites that one dental
        provider can service in a Virtual Dental Home system.
      </li>
      <li>
        In order to carry all of the equipment needed to operate a Virtual
        Dental Home system, it is necessary to have a specially designed
        vehicle.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 4</h3>
    <p>
      The presentation made the point that dental providers can use
      teledentistry in a variety of ways, but each different way of using it
      requires a different type of software and different equipment.
    </p>
    <ul data-correct="2">
      <li>True</li>
      <li>False</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 5</h3>
    <p>The primary goal of a Community-Engaged Oral Health System is:</p>
    <ul data-correct="3">
      <li>
        Getting people like teachers in schools or nurses in nursing homes to
        supervise tooth brushing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Engaging people in community settings for education and screening and
        then referring them to a dental office for a full examination and other
        treatment.

    </ul>

    <h3>Question 6</h3>
    <p>
      The “Concentric Circles of Care in Community Engaged Oral Health Systems”
      concept is based on the idea that:
    </p>
    <ul data-correct="3">
      <li>
        Community screening and prevention sessions can help get people into
        dental offices and clinics.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dental hygienists can take care of the same problems that dentists can,
        but a t lower cost.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most people in the United States do not get dental care, or at least not
        regular care, in dental offices and clinics and engaging other people
        and organizations is essential to provide oral health services for the
        majority of the population.
      </li>
      <li>Most people don’t need much dental care.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 7</h3>
    <p>
      Non-health professionals can help improve the oral health of people in
      their communities by:
    </p>
    <ul data-correct="4">
      <li>Categorizing the level of health or disease in the population.</li>
      <li>Supporting adoption of mouth-healthy habits.</li>
      <li>Performing some dental prevention procedures.</li>
      <li>All of the above</li>

    <h3>Question 1</h3>
    <p>
      Using non-dental personnel as part of a “Concentric-Circles of Care” model
      is important because:
    </p>
    <ul data-correct="4">
      <li>
        Properly trained and supported non-dental personnel are capable of
        providing the same level of oral health care as dental professionals in
        community locations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Services provided by non-dental personnel can be billed at the same rate
        as services billed by oral health professionals and their salaries are
        lower.
      </li>
      <li>
        Oral health professionals can direct the services of non-oral health
        professionals.
      </li>
      <li>
        Even systems that use oral health professionals working in community
        sites cannot reach most of the people in many underserved communities.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 2</h3>
    <p>
      The Remote Kindergarten Oral Health Assessment (KOHA) demonstration was
      important because:
    </p>
    <ul data-correct="3">
      <li>
        It is not possible to obtain results with the same degree of accuracy
        using a remote KOHA assessment as can be obtained with an in-person KOHA
        assessment.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a significant penalty for schools for not completing the KOHA
        for all students.
      </li>
      <li>
        Even though California has a mandated KOHA, most schools don’t complete
        it for most students.
      </li>
      <li>
        Referral for dental care for children in school needs to be done whether
        the KOHA is done in person or remotely.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 3</h3>
    <p>
      Among the factors that led to the success of the Remote Kindergarten Oral
      Health Assessment (KOHA) demonstration were:
    </p>
    <ul data-correct="1">
      <li>
        Remote dentists could visualize the mouth as well or sometimes better by
        looking at photographs than a hygienist could in-person.
      </li>
      <li>
        The in-person non-dental professional was able to tell the remote
        dentist what how to rank the KOHA measures with a higher degree of
        accuracy than the remote dentist could.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dental hygienists could visualize the mouth better in-person than a
        remote dentist could by looking at photographs.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Dental.Com AI system can complete the KOHA with higher accuracy than
        either the in-person hygienist or the remote dentist.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 4</h3>
    <p>
      The AI supported Remote Kindergarten Oral Health Assessment (KOHA)
      demonstration showed that:
    </p>
    <ul data-correct="3">
      <li>
        The specific information gathered for a remote dentist is not important
        because the remote dentist could complete an accurate KOHA with a
        variety of different kinds of information.
      </li>
      <li>The study needs to be repeated because the results were unclear.</li>
      <li>
        The methods and systems used in the demonstration have the potential to
        improve the ability for schools to complete the California mandated KOHA
        and subsequently take steps to improve oral health and oral health
        equity of children attending school.
      </li>
      <li>
        AI systems can now perform dental diagnosis and treatment planning at a
        higher level of accuracy than can be obtained by dentists or dental
        hygienists.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 5</h3>
    <p>
      The mission of the Home Visiting programs in the Inland Empire includes:
    </p>
    <ul data-correct="4">
      <li>Provide material for structured home tooth brushing programs.</li>
      <li>Prepare low- income parents for professional degree programs.</li>
      <li>
        Improve oral health for residents of Riverside and San Bernardino
        Counties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Support self-sufficiency of low-income parents and prepare children for
        school.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 6</h3>
    <p>
      The demonstration of using home visitors in an oral health care system
      conducted in the Inland Empire showed that:
    </p>
    <ul data-correct="3">
      <li>
        Most parents were not doing the right things to raise their children
        with good oral health and their children were at high risk for
        developing dental disease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Home visitors could perform the same services as dental hygienists but
        at a lower cost.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most parents were basically doing the right things to raise their
        children with good oral health and their children were at low risk for
        developing dental disease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Because the children seen by home visitors were very young, the home
        visitors were able to treat most of the dental disease they had in the
        home.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 7</h3>
    <p>
      People with developmental disabilities sometimes need to have dental work
      completed using sedation or general anesthesia. In many parts of
      California and in many other states:
    </p>
    <ul data-correct="3">
      <li>
        The demand for dental care for dental care for people with developmental
        disabilities using sedation or general anesthesia far surpasses the
        available resources resulting in short waiting times for these services.
      </li>
      <li>
        The supply of dental care for dental care for people with developmental
        disabilities using sedation or general anesthesia far surpasses the
        available demand resulting in long waiting times for these services.
      </li>
      <li>
        The demand for dental care for dental care for people with developmental
        disabilities using sedation or general anesthesia far surpasses the
        available resources resulting in long waiting times for these services.
      </li>
      <li>
        The demand for dental care for dental care for people with developmental
        disabilities using sedation or general anesthesia is about equal to the
        available resources resulting in short waiting times for these services.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 8</h3>
    <p>CNU’s Shorten-the-Line Project is expected to demonstrate:</p>
    <ul data-correct="2">
      <li>
        A 50% increase in the available resources for people with developmental
        disabilities needing sedation or general anesthesia for dental care,
        therefore shortening waiting times.
      </li>
      <li>
        A 50 % reduction in people with developmental disabilities needing
        sedation or general anesthesia for dental care, therefore shortening
        waiting times.
      </li>
      <li>
        The ability of behavior support specialists to be able to perform
        preventive dental procedures in residential care facilities.
      </li>
      <li>
        The ability of dental hygienists to perform restorative dentistry
        procedures in residential care facilities.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Question 9</h3>
    <p>
      The major barrier to adopting the Concentric Circles Model is awareness
      because once people become aware of the potential for this type of system
      to improve oral health and lower costs, these models can easily be adopted
      in a variety of locations.

      From: Truth Decay and Tooth Decay: The Role of Dental Teams in Sharing the
      Science of Community Water Fluoridation
    </p>
    <p>
      A patient expresses concern that fluoride causes osteosarcoma because of
      something a family member told them. How might a dentist respond using
      current evidence?
    </p>
    <ul data-correct="2">
      <li>
        Recommend avoiding fluoride completely until more studies confirm its
        safety.
      </li>
      <li>
        Acknowledge the concern and explain that a 2014 study of thousands of
        cases found no link between fluoride in drinking water and bone cancer
        rate over a 25-year period.
      </li>
      <li>
        State that fluoride has been proven to cause bone cancer in populations
        with high natural water fluoride levels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Explain that fluoride exposure is only safe if it comes from bottled
        water, not community water supplies.

        must be performed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Examinations and subsequent interventions performed using teledentistry
        must be based on the same level of information that would be available

      <li>
        Both are “big P” Policies because they involve professional behavior.
      </li>
      <li>
        The chart note rule is a “big P” Policy because it affects patient
        records.
      </li>
      <li>
        The scope of practice regulation is a “little p” policy because it is
        applied at a local office.
